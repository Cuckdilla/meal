# Instructions

I would like you to structure a weekly meal plan for me in the form of a nicely formatted markdown file. Each day and each meal should summarize the kcal and macros (can be an estimation). You may go above or below my target macros if needed, but try to stay within the limits and at the very least within the weekly limit on kcals.

## Background

I am on a cut at the moment, while training for hypertrophy 4 times per week in a Upper, Lower, Push, Pull split.

My daily target macros are as follows:
- kcals: 1900
- Protein: 182g
- Fat: 84g
- Carbs: 104g

## Foods

Below is a comprehensive list of foods and ingredients that we like and have easily available. This list is not strictly exclusive, but gives you a good indication of what I have available.
- Chicken breast
- Ground beef (5% lean)
- Ground chicken
- Beef (sirloin or tenderloin)

## Meal complexity

I'd like my meals to stay fairly simple, as I weight everything and need to register it in the MacroFactor app. It is much easier to do so when there are less ingredients to take into account. The meals can be fairly similar from day to day, I don't have an issue with that, but some variation would be nice.

## Suppliments

I take 5-6 grams of Creatine every morning together with 40ug vitamin D, magnesium citrate, and some fish oils.
